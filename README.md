## Personal Health Log

**What will the the application do?**

This application will have an arbritrary number of daily logs. Each log will
have the following health-related questions for users to fill out each day:
- How many hours of sleep did you get? (multiple choice)
- What did you eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner? (short answer)
- What kind of physical activity did you engage in? (short answer)
- Overall, how did you feel today? (select from a series of emojis)
The user's answers will be saved and stored in the application.

**Who will use it?**

This application can be used by students, who often overlook
their health when they get busy. It can be used as a way to check in on
their mental and physical well-being and identify
when this part of their life requires more attention.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

In first year, I let my health fell to the bottom of my priority list
due to how occupied I was with other components of my 
life. This only realized this when it began to take 
a physical toll on me. The use of this application will prevent students from
overlooking their health, and alert them when they aren't taking adequate care 
of themselves. It's a tool that I could've benefited from at this time in my life.
